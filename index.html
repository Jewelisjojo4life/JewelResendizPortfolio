              <p>
     I am currently transitioning to a role as a Software QA Tester, building on my 10 years of experience in manufacturing and quality assurance. During this time, I have developed a strong foundation in attention to detail, problem-solving, and root cause analysis. I have successfully worked independently and proactively to optimize productivity, implement improvements, and enhance workplace conditions. In my pursuit of this new career path, I have taken the initiative to learn CSS, HTML, and Git through personal projects, further solidifying my technical skills. My experience as a team lead has equipped me with collaborative skills essential for working effectively in cross-functional environments. I am motivated by the challenge of proving myself in a new field and am committed to continuous learning and professional growth as I embark on this journey in Software QA.

I am currently enrolled in a comprehensive Software QA Engineering bootcamp at Careerist, where I am gaining essential skills in quality assurance principles and practices. The curriculum covers various testing methodologies, including functional, regression, and performance testing, and emphasizes the development of detailed test plans and test cases. I am also acquiring hands-on experience with automated testing tools such as Selenium, JIRA, and TestRail, along with skills in defect tracking and API testing to validate back-end functionality. This program is equipping me with a solid foundation to excel in a Software QA role.  <br />

                  For this project I created a password generator. It allows
                  you to generate passwords between 8 and 128 characters and is
                  fuctional enough to let you know that you can't do anymore or
                  any less than a certain amount of options.
