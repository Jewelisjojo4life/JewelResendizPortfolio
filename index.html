              <p>
                I'm currently going through a career change to become a
                full-stack developer. I've been working on small projects in my
                own time and fully immersed in a 6-month boot camp at GA Tech
                while attending college to obtain my Bachelors in software
                engineering. I come from a manufacturing background with 10
                years of experience. In those years, I have been able to work
                independently and proactively investigate and solve technical
                challenges, I've optimized productivity, suggested better
                workplace conditions and had them approved, and worked as a
                team lead. I'm motivated by the fact that I will need to prove
                myself to show my willingness to learn something new and take on
                the challenges involved with becoming a developer.

                2023 - Jun 2023<br />
                Intense 6-month boot camp I am attending to become a full-stack
                developer. I have done many assignments working alone and
                coordinating with other classmates to complete projects. We are
                learning skills such as jQuery, MongoDB, Github, SQL,
                Express.js, Node.js, Gitlab, Web Applications, JavaScript,
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), GitHub, and HTML just to
                name a few. My goal is to join an internship after graduation and
            be part of a company that will allow me to receive real world
                experience and mold me as I will be a fresh canvas to
                teach.<br />

            	 I decided that my previous career path didn't align with my
                future goals. Now I will be due to graduate in 2025 with full
                intent to become a software engineer.<br />

                I attended here to receive my bachelor's in Mechanical
                Engineering. Unfortunately, this school did not have the class I
                wanted to transfer to and I had to switch schools. I left the
                school with a 3.7 GPA and was grateful for what I learned while
                I was there.

                <p>
					Worked with a classmate to get this done. I was the only one
					that implemented a clock on this project which I was very proud of. Calendar changes color based on the time, grey being past,
					red being present, and green meaning future. You can save your
					info in the local storage by clicking the save button and when
					the page is refreshed,it stays on the schedule.

                <p>
                  For this project I created a password generator. It allows
                  you to generate passwords between 8 and 128 characters and is
                  fuctional enough to let you know that you can't do anymore or
                  any less than a certain amount of options.
